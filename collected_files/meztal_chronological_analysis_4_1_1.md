# MezTal Project – Chronological Analysis

This document assembles everything we know about the MezTal/Wix Studio site redesign across **all recorded sessions** (as of 2025‑11‑11).  It provides a chronological narrative of actions, decisions and corrections, explains how adjustments evolved over time, and highlights unresolved tasks.  The goal is to maintain a consistent memory across chats, preventing duplication and unfocused work.

## 1. Early Sessions – Site Architecture and Planning

1. **Initial discovery:** The user requested help designing a modern, SEO‑friendly architecture for MezTal.com.  After comparing competitor sites and reviewing the cleaned architecture spreadsheet, we proposed a hierarchical structure consisting of top‑level sections (Home, Services, Solutions, Locations, Resources, Case Studies, About, Contact) and clear subpages.  Services were further broken into pillars (e.g. IT staffing, application development outsourcing, digital marketing) with spokes and leaf pages.  A dynamic CMS model in Wix Studio was recommended to scale content.

2. **Architecture refinement:** The proposed structure was iteratively refined based on competitor insights and the user’s feedback.  We aligned pages to key business objectives (lead generation and scalability) and clarified the difference between Services (what MezTal offers) and Solutions/Industries (who the services help).  A comprehensive tree diagram was produced to illustrate the hierarchy and recommended URL patterns.

## 2. CMS Creation & Field Configuration (Sessions through 2025‑11‑10)

1. **Creating collections:** In the next sessions we opened the Wix Studio editor and created six CMS collections: `services`, `industries` (solutions), `case_studies`, `resources`, `locations` and `people`.  For each collection, we added the necessary fields: text, rich content, images, multi‑reference fields and SEO metadata.  For example, `services` includes `short_description`, `long_description`, `thumbnail_image`, `hero_image`, `related_services`, `related_solutions` and `meta_description`.

2. **Handling field issues:** We confirmed that Wix automatically generates slugs and meta titles based on the primary field and that custom slug/meta fields are unnecessary.  Meta descriptions were added manually where needed.  When Save buttons in the field editor were unresponsive, pressing **Enter** reliably saved the field.

3. **Completion status:** By 2025‑11‑11, all collections were fully configured with required fields.  Dynamic list and item pages were automatically generated by Wix Studio for each collection, meaning no manual page creation was required at this stage.

## 3. Attempted Page Customisation & Obstacles (Sessions on 2025‑11‑11)

1. **Dynamic page verification:** After setting up collections, we verified that dynamic pages existed for each collection (`services`, `industries`, `case_studies`, `resources`, `locations`, `people`).  The pages were still using Wix’s default layout.

2. **Repeater insertion:** We attempted to customise the **Solutions List** page (services list) by adding a repeater to display service cards.  We inserted a new section, selected a grid layout and automatically added a repeater.  However, connecting the repeater to the `services` dataset proved difficult due to unfamiliarity with Wix’s dataset anchor mechanism.  Misclicks often selected the section rather than the repeater, and unconfigured datasets were created or deleted.  The repeater remained unbound.

3. **Other pages:** No customisation was attempted on other dynamic pages or static pages such as Home, About or Contact.  Navigation and home page design remain untouched.

## 4. Logging & Memory Management Evolution

1. **Initial logs:** The first logs for 2025‑11‑11 captured high‑level actions (collection creation, field additions, dynamic page checks, repeater attempts) and two errors (dataset binding failure and a GitHub 403 error).  The logs followed a basic structure with timestamp, description and category fields.

2. **Logging improvements:** Recognising the need for better context recall, we drafted a `logging_improvements.md` document with recommendations: categorise logs (CMS setup, design, API operations, errors, learnings), add metadata fields (`status`, `duration`, `tool_used`) and generate an end‑of‑session summary.  We emphasised local log storage and manual GitHub uploads due to read‑only API limitations.

3. **Context documents:** To further reduce memory drift, we created `meztal_project_context.md` (a comprehensive index of completed work, outstanding tasks and data file locations) and `open_tasks.md` (a master checklist of unresolved items).  We also started generating `session_summary_<date>.md` files summarising each day’s work.  These documents were stored locally and uploaded to GitHub for future retrieval.

4. **Chronological integrity:** When new documents superseded older versions, we adopted a naming scheme that includes the session date (e.g. `analysis_2025-11-11.md`, `session_summary_2025-11-11.md`).  For general context files (e.g. `meztal_project_context.md` and `open_tasks.md`), we placed them in the date‑stamped logs folder to indicate their creation time.  This approach maintains chronological integrity without mixing raw logs and narrative documents.

## 5. Gap Analysis (As of 2025‑11‑11)

Despite significant progress on the CMS and architecture, several gaps remain:

1. **Dynamic page customisation:** No list or item pages have been fully customised.  Repeaters need to be bound to datasets, item pages must display content elegantly and CTAs should be added.

2. **Home and navigation:** The home page and top‑level navigation menu have not been built.  Visitors currently see blank templates.

3. **Content import:** Services, industries and other collections are still empty; data from `meztal_wix_import.csv` and other spreadsheets must be imported after user confirmation.

4. **Process automation:** There is no automatic context retrieval; each new session requires manually scanning previous logs or context documents.  Self‑prompt triggers should be added so that mentioning “MezTal” or “Wix Studio” automatically loads the latest `session_summary.md` and `open_tasks.md`.

## 6. Recommendations & Advanced Techniques

1. **Structured session workflow:** Divide each future session into distinct phases: (a) load context (parse the latest summary and open tasks), (b) complete a single unresolved task (e.g. bind a repeater), (c) record actions with metadata, (d) update open tasks and generate a summary.  Do not move to new tasks before finishing the current one.

2. **Repeater binding guide:** Create a concise guide for connecting repeaters to datasets:
   - Insert a repeater through the Add panel and choose a grid or blank layout.
   - Click the dataset anchor (small cylinder icon) inside the repeater; select **Connect Repeater**.
   - Choose the appropriate dynamic dataset (e.g. `services`).  Map each element (text, image, button) to the corresponding field.
   - Test that cards display data and link to the item page.

3. **Home page & navigation:** Build the home page using sections for hero, service previews, solutions by industry, case study highlights, resource teasers, location map and testimonials.  Configure a sticky navigation bar linking to each top‑level section.

4. **Automated context retrieval:** Implement a start‑of‑session script (or manual step) that fetches the latest `session_summary.md` and `open_tasks.md` from GitHub (read‑only) and loads them into the agent’s memory.  This ensures the agent knows where to resume without scanning multiple documents.

5. **Flat log storage with date stamps:** If using a flat `logs` directory, include the date in each filename (e.g. `2025-11-11_agent-log.jsonl`, `2025-11-11_session_summary.md`) to maintain chronological order.  Keep narrative documents separate from raw logs for clarity.

6. **Periodic reminders:** At the end of each major task or session, remind the user to download and upload new documents to GitHub.  The agent should also remind itself to update the context and tasks lists.

## 7. Conclusion

The MezTal project has progressed from conceptual architecture to an established CMS structure with six collections and auto-generated dynamic pages.  Logging practices and context management have evolved to reduce memory drift and support continuous work.  However, significant tasks remain: designing dynamic pages, building the home page, importing content, and implementing automated context retrieval.  By following the recommendations above and maintaining the updated context documents, future sessions can proceed efficiently and avoid repeating past mistakes.
