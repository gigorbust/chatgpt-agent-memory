## FRAMEWORK SELECTION BY PAGE TYPE

### **PILLAR PAGES** (Awareness Stage - Educational)

**Primary Framework: GAP SELLING**
- Show current state (hiring challenges, cost pressures, timeline issues)
- Paint future state (efficient nearshore team, cost savings, quality work)
- Create urgency around the gap

**Supporting Framework: SPIN SELLING**
- Situation: Where are they now?
- Problem: What specific pain are they experiencing?
- Implication: What happens if they don't solve it?
- Need-Payoff: What value does solving it create?

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** - Relatable scenario showing the problem
2. **Problem Agitation** - Make the pain visceral and real
3. **Gap Identification** - Current state vs. desired state
4. **Solution Introduction** - How nearshore solves the gap
5. **Proof/Evidence** - Why Mexico/Guadalajara specifically

7. **Industry Applications** - Show relevance across 6 industries
8. **Soft CTA** - Learn more, explore options

**Tone:** Consultative expert, like a trusted advisor

## UNIVERSAL ELEMENTS FOR ALL PAGES

### **Jobs to be Done Lens**
Always understand: What "job" is the customer hiring this solution to do?
- Functional job (scale development capacity)
- Social job (look smart to board/stakeholders)
- Emotional job (reduce stress, gain confidence)

### **Customer-Centric Selling**
Align with buyer's journey stage:
- **Awareness:** Help them understand they have a problem
- **Consideration:** Help them evaluate solutions
- **Decision:** Make it easy to choose MezTal

### **The 6 Industries Rule**
Every page must naturally mention how solution applies to:
1. Healthcare
2. Senior Living
3. Real Estate
4. Financial Services
5. Tech/SaaS
6. General Business

Don't force it - weave naturally into examples and use cases.

## COPYWRITING PRINCIPLES

### **1. Story-Driven, Not Feature-Driven**
❌ "We provide nearshore developers"
✅ "Your CTO needs to ship that feature by Q1. Your team is underwater. We put experienced developers on your team in 3 weeks."

### **2. Conversational, Not Corporate**
❌ "Our organization facilitates the procurement of..."
✅ "Here's how this actually works..."

### **3. Specific, Not Generic**
❌ "We deliver quality solutions"
✅ "A senior Java developer who'd cost $150K in the US runs approximately $75K in Guadalajara"

### **4. Problem-First, Not Solution-First**
Start with their pain, then show the path out.

### **5. Varied Rhythm**
- Mix long and short sentences
- Break up paragraphs
- Use subheads as stepping stones
- Questions engage readers
- Lists provide clarity

### **6. Show, Don't Tell**
❌ "We're experts"
✅ "Guadalajara produces 40,000 engineering graduates annually. Intel, IBM, Oracle, and HP operate development centers there."

## CONTENT FLOW ARCHITECTURE

### **Opening (First 2-3 Paragraphs)**
1. Scenario Hook or Pain Point
2. Agitate the problem
3. Promise a solution

### **Body (Educational Middle)**
1. **What It Is** - Clear definition
2. **Why It Works** - The logic/mechanism
3. **How It Works** - Practical process
4. **Who It's For** - Industry applications
5. **Proof** - Evidence, examples, specifics

### **Closing (Last Section)**
1. Overcome final objections (FAQ)
2. Reinforce MezTal's unique value
3. Clear call-to-action

---

## FAQ STRUCTURE (Every Page)

Use **SPIN elements** in FAQ:
- Address Situation questions ("When should we...?")
- Address Problem questions ("What if...?")
- Address Implication questions ("How do we handle...?")
- Address Need-Payoff questions ("What results can we expect...?")

3-5 FAQs per page, answering the most critical objections/questions.

---

## INTERNAL LINKING STRATEGY

**Pillar → Leaf/Spoke:**
Link to 10-15 related specific pages

**Leaf → Pillar:**
Link back to parent pillar for context

**Leaf → Related Leaf:**
Cross-link to related services/roles

**All → Industries:**
Link to relevant industry pages when mentioned

## MEZTAL-SPECIFIC VOICE

### **We Are:**
- Consultative experts (not salespeople)
- Straight-shooters (honest about realities)
- Practical problem-solvers (not dreamers)
- Experienced guides (been there, done that)

### **We Are NOT:**
- Corporate/stiff
- Overpromising/hypey
- Vague/generic
- Aggressive/pushy

### **Phrases We Use:**
- "Here's how this actually works..."
- "Let's be honest about..."
- "The reality is..."
- "Most companies find that..."
- "approximately 50% cost savings" (not "cheap")
- "roughly half the cost"

### **Phrases We Avoid:**
- "World-class" / "Best-in-class"
- "Leverage" / "Synergy"
- "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing"
- "Guaranteed" / "Always"
- Exact percentages without "approximately"

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

### **Factual Accuracy:**
✅ "cost approximately 50% less"
❌ "work 50% less" (offensive and wrong)

✅ "approximately 50% cost savings"
❌ "exactly 50% savings"

✅ "Guadalajara, Mexico"
❌ Never just "Mexico" without city

✅ Only facts from meztal-facts-database
❌ No invented statistics or claims

### **The Industries:**
Every page should naturally include examples/mentions of:
- Healthcare (patient portals, EHR, telemedicine)
- Senior Living (resident care, family portals)
- Real Estate (property management, listings)
- Financial Services (transactions, fraud detection)
- Tech/SaaS (product development, scaling)
- General business applications

### **Internal Links:**
Minimum 5-10 per page, naturally woven into content

### **CTAs:**
- Pillar pages: 2-3 soft CTAs ("learn more", "explore")
- Leaf pages: 2-3 medium CTAs ("schedule consultation")
- Spoke pages: 2-3 strong CTAs ("talk to expert", "get started")
