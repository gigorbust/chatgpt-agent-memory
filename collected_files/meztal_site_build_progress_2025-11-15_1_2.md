## SESSION NOTES

This session focused on **strategic page structure completion** rather than content population. The rationale:

1. **Foundation First:** Establishing all required pages before content ensures proper site structure
2. **Parallel Work:** Content can be populated more efficiently once all pages are created
3. **Compliance:** Maintaining brand language and proper hierarchy while building
4. **Documentation:** Comprehensive gap analysis provides clear roadmap for content phase

**Ready for Next Phase:** All prerequisite pages are now created and ready for content population and collection integration.
