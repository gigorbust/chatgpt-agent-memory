## 🛑 Zero Tolerance Policy (Enforced in All Outputs)

- ❌ No “same time zone” – must say “overlapping business hours”
- ❌ No “Flextal” – MezTal branding only
- ❌ No merging Blog + Resources
- ❌ No separate service pages for staff augmentation / synonyms
- ❌ No invented services/verticals not in approved sources

---

## 🧪 Strategy Hygiene

- Sitemap is SEO-first, not Wix copy
- Nav follows funnel segmentation
- All page types have “next step” links
- Role count is dynamic; 47 is NOT a constraint
- Content matches real Closed-Won role demand
- Case study CMS fully separates verticals and service context
