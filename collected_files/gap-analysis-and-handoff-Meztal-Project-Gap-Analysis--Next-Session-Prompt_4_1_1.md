### ⚠️ CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

**Gap 1: Architecture CSV Access**
- **Issue:** Architecture — Cleaned Map CSV not uploaded to current/recent sessions
- **Impact:** Cannot verify exact URLs, priority scores, or full page details
- **Workaround:** Using documented priorities from previous session summaries
- **Resolution Needed:** Upload Architecture CSV to next session OR confirm priorities are accurate

**Gap 2: Earlier Session Content (12 Pages)**
- **Issue:** 12 pages generated in earlier sessions contain FORBIDDEN content (dollar amounts, timeline claims)
- **Status:** These exist in chat session bfe96cb5-4620-4bc9-9c1e-f4fac8204812
- **Resolution Needed:** Either audit/fix in that session OR regenerate clean versions
- **Current Approach:** Documented but not addressed; not counting toward 389 total

**Gap 3: URL Verification**
- **Issue:** All 19 completed pages use estimated URLs, not verified against Architecture
- **Impact:** May need URL corrections before Wix import
- **Resolution Needed:** Cross-reference with Architecture CSV when available

**Gap 4: Artifact Portability**
- **Issue:** Artifacts from previous sessions not accessible in new sessions
- **Impact:** Must recreate context each time token limit reached
- **Workaround:** Comprehensive handoff prompts (like this one)
- **Limitation:** Technical - cannot be fully resolved

**Gap 5: Missing Content Types**
- **Completed:** High-priority B2B services, strategic industries, core services (19 pages)
- **Missing:** IT Staff Augmentation, DevOps, Network Engineering, Database Admin, QA/Testing, PM, BI, RevOps, Technical Writing, and 361 more pages
- **Priority:** Next batch should focus on IT core services (9.0+ scores)
