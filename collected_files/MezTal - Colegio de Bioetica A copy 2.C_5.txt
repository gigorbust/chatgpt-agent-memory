Speaker 1  00:00
I'm pager right now that just describes our services. And they will like, often forward that one pager to the person, or they're talking, oh my gosh, like I always have, you know, things, can't find accountants, whatever they have, like things missing. So they tell them, Oh, you got to talk to Sarah, you going to talk to Vince. And I make an intro, they send a one pager and they send an intro. But, for instance, one of the guys that works for us as a referral partner, he's like, a male dance. And he, you know, when he's talking, he just is like, Dude, you should do this. I think they have staff, like, doesn't have a heavy Mac on home. He's not, but he's not. He doesn't know what to say. He really knows how to articulate what we do. Okay. But he has actually brought in several referrals like and so he knows people and he uses word of mouth to just say talk to Sarah events, and we close the deal.

Unknown Speaker  01:00
So whatever he's doing is working. Okay, got it. Yeah,

Speaker 1  01:02
that's not the message. So what we're trying to do is formalize the program and have referral partners who once a month get an email from us. Updates on mez Tao as a community, the mission that we're on any new testimonials, our newsletter, so that they feel part of the Mezcal community and their top went Mezcal is top of mind for them. With this monthly emails, we also want to give them tools that are top of mind that they can use when they talk to people like how to make sure that you can articulate our value proposition. You know what model of business we have or not, you know, Miss stepping on saying what we do. So, today, our goal is to show you an outsider, all of our resources that we have available, we don't need your immediate feedback on each resource, we want you to digest it and think about all of the products that we have the assets that we have right now. So what the first thing is, we have something called y God, y ellos is a list and then go through the documents, we have something called Why GDL and when clients come for an immersion trip where potential clients come down to Guadalajara we do a presentation on why would you do business in Mexico, why Guadalajara is important about the economic value of it. Then also our founders history where we came from the whole spiel about mes how as a whole. We also talked about the type of roles the type of cost savings what we could do for your business testimonials, it's a very big comprehensive deck, we want to show you this because some of it could be in like we believe if we put together tools. We believe if we put together tools someone like you are going to want to watch a video of why GDL and look for like the whole hour that we do that presentation, you're going to want to fully understand the history. Someone like Paul Mellon is never going to read that or listen to that video if we record it. But he would do like a 10 minute summary video that he could then replicate. So we feel as an asset, we have this we will put it in like a folder for the recruiting the referral partners. Not everyone will read it. But so or watch it but the people who really want to, like get involved want to know the history, they will watch the whole thing. We think because I'm going to put out to make list we these are things we have now. But we're going to make other things. I think we need to record this lat long version and record a soft, short 10 minute training video of what our value is. So I'll show you what we have. Now. We have a one pager, I'll show you that because it's the easiest thing to just forward, hey, I think you could probably use my cell take a look at what they do. That's it, even if you don't tell them what we do, you can just for the one page. There's also an opportunity to take the recruiting. I mean, the referral partner program that we're now trying to formalize and invite them to all of our immersion trips every month. I mean, every quarter we do an immersion trip. We take potential clients, we take current clients, we invite them, they come down for a three day experience, you know of this, but I think it's a valuable tool to engage the recruiting sorry, the referral partners. Because if they come down once, then they see the space. They know the people they learn about the firsthand, and then when they're back out in the field with whatever they do. They are going to be able to help us more because they'll be like No, you really have to understand it's more sophisticated than you think. Because so the buyer will be better. I think we'll have two types of referral partners. One will be sure sure, sure. I'm already talking to people especially in senior living, especially in age tech. I get it I'll just send them a one pager. And that's it. Then we'll have other people who are not in our industry, but maybe on the digital side of things not in person, not at all these conferences we already go to, but on a digital side of things could do more digital outreach for like target markets or target client types. And they might need a different set of resources than the people who are just talking about it with their colleagues, like a salesperson doesn't plan to actually go to a conference is different than another senior living operator, who's going to tell their friends, so the referral partner like group is going to be somewhat diverse. So that's why we might need different resources. So we have a video, for instance, I'll show you of the immersion of an immersion trip. We don't want this one public because there's alcohol. And that is not the brand for as tough. So we're not putting it on LinkedIn. Well, I know but it's not. So we do, however, talk about the culture of Mezcal and the culture of tequila, the town of tequila, and the beauty of that when you get to know us, and it is a part of it. But we just don't want the asset out publicly the

Speaker 2  06:13
work ethic of the culture of creating such a beautiful, yeah, but

Speaker 1  06:18
not come down here and get drunk. That's not our message for sure. So this one, I think we could give it to select referral partners. But we have to somewhat tell them when to use it. For instance, I know a group wants to come down, but they also want to talk about business, they, I could send it to that particular person, but I'm not going to put that publicly, I'm not going to put it on LinkedIn. We have a new document that's like the one pager but it talks about the types of roles we fill, we think that's going to be useful for the referral partner so that they know how to answer when you talk to a brand new person and like you should use them. Well, yeah, like for the accounting role? Yes. Like you have to be able to answer that. So we have kind of sample roles. We also have a lot that we're building around community in Mexico with a community of employees, why we differentiate against other models, why we differentiate against other staffing companies, other competitors, is because we are building a community, and a lot of benefits for our employees, including a community of events and trainings and discounts and things to make them really feel a part of meshed how not just work for a client in the US. And this is a selling point to our clients. So as we help with retention, we help with community building, to keep the people working for you, we also keep them engaged with us. So there's like, you want to be able to say that you need to like us brand new to this somewhere in our documents, you shouldn't have to just extrapolate this and say, Oh, how like, how does that help me get clients for you, we should dot that line over to a resource for you that has the talking point of like, why is it important in Mex, that was important to you client, then I'm building a community in Mexico. Doing that, so that the more stickiness and consideration we have for that community, the longer they stay working for you, because they're also happy with their employer, we are the employer of record. So then we have a community calendar, and events calendar for here and we can show you like all the types of events we engage we care about the employee's health and well being and all of their dimensions of wellness and like really their mental health and their physical health. We have yoga classes and all of these things to show you that

Unknown Speaker  08:48
benefits plus at once it's a discount discounts.

Speaker 1  08:53
Yeah, the benefits and discounts that we offer for the community members here, we have a document, the resource group will show it to you. And then the newsletter is something we do monthly. And we'll show you this is it's a template. So we show you how we how we utilize that but features and employees story. It features a holiday it features a tip about working remotely or something about leadership and summarizes the events from the prior month. So it's a nice kind of resource that we have. We probably under utilize it. And so I think the referral partners if they were to get this every month, you want to read like what's up, I've noticed out and once you're thinking about us, you probably refer us more so if but I don't have the referral partners getting those are reading those right now. So it's stuff that know me and I are brainstorming how we would make you feel like you care about Mezcal and want to talk about

Speaker 2  09:51
us. Yes, it's great. Click collateral so

Speaker 1  09:55
far, so I think it's pretty good for sure. That's

Unknown Speaker  09:58
awesome content.

Speaker 1  09:59
So one thing we haven't defined for our referral partners or for you yet is the ideal customer. And talking points for the value proposition, and we have it all in here, but I think we need to pull it out. So it's super simple for you. Sure. And then the thing that the other thing we don't have is the the difference of the model, which I'll explain to you, in a minute, but to me, these are the three things that I've walked away from it said, Well, we have a lot of stuff. But if I do all this to you, what else do you need to be successful? Right now, I think those are the three things you'll need that I didn't give you in this. So if we show these to you, you don't have to learn them and absorb all of the evidence to show these to you. I would like to get to the point where it What else do you need, like oh, and I want to 10 minute video, this will be an hour to an hour and a half. And I think why GDL somehow needs to be consolidated, we go between an hour and an hour half of your presented. So I think in order for you to. Okay, pretty much on time. So I think in I think in like 2025 minutes, I can go have no me go through these assets. So you see them, not that you understand them or read them fully, but that you see what they are, then I'd like to be able to articulate to you. Because you'll have a ton of questions because you're not going to read all of them. Right now, I'd like to like to articulate to you the ideal customer, our value proposition and our business model. Because these are three things that people mess up all the time. And then from then, in the last five or 10 minutes, what I would like from you is what's missing, to make you successful as a referral partner. Okay. So let's go through the assets first. So that you can see, because like, even with all these assets, I'm recognizing a couple things are missing. So I think you'll see like, I would I would still have this question. Yeah. And then I just want to see what else we need to create. Oh,

Speaker 2  12:33
I'll try to come up with those with questions as we go through, but it might I might need to.

Unknown Speaker  12:41
But no, probably you're gonna think

Speaker 1  12:54
so now let's turn to them. I mean, I we are not going to present them to you, we're going to click through them. Because everything take will take way too long. If but I want you to know what exists, then we're going to create a charity created the master folder, you can go through and read them. And then what like if you look at them right now, you're probably going to say, I just want to know more about that one thing. I don't want all of that. You know, you might realize that sockets are too much

Unknown Speaker  13:24
the more the better for you.

Speaker 1  13:25
Yeah, like once one pager but I like we have to figure out how to get this to be short. And and like a package thing that the referrals partners will read. Someone who is dedicated will want more and will provide it. So that but okay, let's show. So, Georgia, this is our day, this is the wide GDL presentation. This is what we do when people come in for the immersion charter, it takes an hour to an hour and a half, we will record a visual of this, we'll record a presentation of this so that the rest of our partners have this.

Speaker 2  14:01
Do you mind if I record not presenting it? Like just as you go through this? Do you mind

Speaker 1  14:07
if I record? I don't care, but you're gonna need that because you're gonna have this whole folder. Okay, I just thought whatever. Okay, good. Okay, so we go through team, but you do have to pay attention.

Unknown Speaker  14:20
That's all fine. So you pay attention later.

Speaker 1  14:22
Okay, so we go for team. We go through a wide like actual Guadalajara overview like the white one art is unique.

Unknown Speaker  14:32
Right? Yes.

Speaker 1  14:35
Why Guadalajara? What the business zones are in doing business in Guadalajara. All the companies that work in Guadalajara, the type of type of universities there are and all of the type of technical learnings there are in Guadalajara, so we share like that student pool. We show all of the other large namebrand corporates that work here to try to validate read all this later, but just know the topics. Again, we could partner with any of these businesses, it legitimizes why she was what water the heart is not a like, village. Why, like something more about this area, the economy in the area and release goes into the GDP boost goes into. Like our positioning economically within the area, the unemployment rates, some business people really want to get into this stuff. I don't think the referral partners need to know this. But it's important to just have a tour our business partners, why people invest in Guadalajara, we talk about general nearshoring. Here's like all the direct flights from the US. So it shows how it's easy to come to business here. It shows you again, why you were doing business in Mexico, the trade barriers, the lower costs, the operating costs, we go into this, but we talk about why do business in Mexico, benefits we have to provide so that people are aware of the legal requirements of the benefits. The holiday calendar so that they're aware, it's different than the US are benefits for our own employees. Because we have a wellness program. These are all of our comprehensive benefits that we have curated specifically, like extra things for academic discounts and services and making them want to be part of so calendar events. We care about all dimensions of wellness with yoga classes, and celebrating mental health and awareness, like healthy living. And so we give a sample to show we really invest time and energy into building this community. If you are working here, what our office space is like, again, way too much for a typical referral partner. So that's really what we present the value of

Unknown Speaker  16:53
retention, right? That's basically what that Yeah, sounds good. Yeah.

Speaker 1  16:56
client testimonials in case people want to see what people say about us, you'll get all this later, current clients, we continue to grow this so that they see some familiar remember right now Senior Living age tech, they know each other's names. So if I gave that to someone else, they might not know these names. But for what we're currently doing, it works. But like wild is the largest US edibles, marijuana edibles company, like, I would need to figure out what else is going to be valuable to other people who are in that type of industry. If we're going to target that industry, for instance. We give sample resumes to the clients or during that meeting so that they can see the type of talent when they look at the big four and I'm like, wait, you have real accountants? Yeah, with real accountants like before, like the See, like no, like Deloitte and KPMG like these, like in the accounting world, they think we're gonna get like backyard accountants who learned math on their own and we're like no only worked for major internet, IBM, like we pulled them from IBM we've changed perception is what the goal is to change perception in this meeting. testimonials from the employees and building community that cares and so then we can answer questions. So that's the first asset talk much through the others because they're self explanatory, but I'll show you the other assets. So this is the one pager you'll get it typically just says what we do why we do it and some testimonials and how to reach us That's it. Let's do the one with the rolls. So we added kind of an additional brochure to the one pager that shows the benefits the events kind of summarized the leadership team summarize the culture of why we work here summarize and then what types of roles because a lot of people want to know like they think we only do accounting because they got referred to from someone who got an accountant but they never expanded to marketing well wait you do marketing to like yeah, these are the all the roles will fill up for other clients these are roles we have right now for them so it's yeah, it's and it doesn't have to be senior living and accountant can work at a real estate firm a tech company a school system whatever. So this is valuable for our referral partners to know the types of roles

Unknown Speaker  19:34
attorney client

Unknown Speaker  19:34
I did a sample

Unknown Speaker  19:38
since yesterday because I simply needed

Unknown Speaker  19:44
to talk to each member

Speaker 1  19:46
let's go to the benefits Okay, so So you have this GEORGE This is like, again, building community for our mass tell employees this is These are services that are discounts and negotiations that do not get passed off to the client for cost. It's just things we've added in to that drive value and help with retention, like the discounts in their car services here or their discounts in taking a an extra education class, we've negotiated on their behalf lots of things to keep the employee happy and engaged. That this is a major differentiator, probably underutilized by us all together may have major differentiators and a lot of other Mexican companies, a lot of Mexican companies, you're a number, they don't care, and they're not going to negotiate on your behalf. We care and like if you need something, we're going to try to negotiate it we hear about needing childcare. So like, let's try to get a childcare partner, like we are doing things to try to help keep people healthy and happy, including their home life healthy and happy. Their travel discounts, like when they have their time off, and we feature them and stuff. So because people want to know, clients want to know, how do we differentiate in the Mexican market, because they don't know the Mexican market? Well, we differentiate from Amazon because if you're going to be an accountant, we'd much rather be an accountant working or like a manager not overseeing a manufacturing plant, who doesn't care about you. But like working for mission driven companies almost both so far all of our clients have mission driven businesses, they are working to help improve the lives of older adults, they're helping people aged better, they are working for companies that care. And we're building a community that cares. And people would rather work for companies who care about them in the world than just working for. I mean, I won't say Amazon's probably a bad example, because everyone else worked for Amazon. But you know, manufacturing, as an industry is not as mission driven as aging services. And what's a manufacturer? Let's show you a typical newsletter. So this goes out right now, monthly, and there's a message for me, you know, thanking them usually giving a quote, commenting on like, how hard working and thanking the team and our clients for all the work based usually around a quote, we talk them something about a culture or a holiday, something to feature what we're all doing that month, usually collectively, like the Olympics, the history of the Olympics, and why it started. And then there's meet a member. And we we vary that holiday, by the way, just because it's kind of interesting to me. Sometimes we feature a Mexican holiday, because people are going to have a day off. And our clients don't know why they have that day off, because we don't have that day in the US. And then vice versa. Like it's going to be a disruption in business, and they're going to be working with their bosses in the US aren't working. And they have a day off in the US like, can we value each other's cultures so that they're hearing about that? And then meet the members? We always do a know me, does it get to know you and document when someone starts? Like what is their history? What's important to them? What are their hobbies? Like why did they join mes? How? Really getting to know them? And if they've ever seen somewhere in the world, they like what is your goal in life. And then we feature all that in a like, truly more personalized, not so much about their job, but that so that everybody can see the face and get to know the

Speaker 2  23:41
people? This is external? And internal? Or right now it's

Speaker 1  23:45
all of our current clients. Is it all of our employees to Yeah, right? Yes, yeah, all of our employees, our current clients, we do share a couple things. Sometimes that probably shouldn't be like, we don't put all of it on LinkedIn, or we don't put it publicly because we feature sometimes the logos of our clients and I feel like it's okay because it's internal. But we don't put that truly publicly. But we've done a dat adaptations where we pull from a newsletter to a one page or take a piece of it and featured on LinkedIn because we know it's not violating any confidentiality. shroom we always welcome new members that joined the month before we don't say the client they work for it because this is about myself and they've joined Miss Tao whether they're working for another care or different clients. So it's just welcome to the team. Always explore new benefit that's on the page, how they access it, where they can go to it then if there's a new one here, then adds it to the benefits list. Usually a tip about leadership about time management, some sort of it's usually an article we just summarize and then linked to the article. It's, but it's you also, if it's a trend we've noticed here As an issue, and we sometimes try to feature they're like how we manage a remote team while keeping culture like typical magazines do that we just featuring it's not public, we're not making money off that coverage of the events really personal of people that participated and if we had any trainings or education sessions we talked about those and feature those really showing that we have an engaged community. And if clients come we show that but we also show like the next events that are coming in the next month or that month, and then any if client comes down or an employee goes to us, we asked to feature that story to show that people really engage across culture so that is an option to send to you or to the network monthly that's not going to them right now. I think it's valuable for the referral partners to see it and to feel like oh my gosh, they really are doing so much I got to talk about so it's a tool and we do it anyway so why not send it to them? So okay, immersion should video even know what an American ship is? We don't have to show you that right now. Rolls dock benefits Community Calendar newsletter merchant trip invite one pager And why'd you do well did I show you the most recent promotion trip it's two minutes.

Unknown Speaker  27:07
Right recognize your brand

Speaker 1  28:01
right no we won't take you there. That's

Unknown Speaker  28:16
it does that sound nice and green versus oh, oh.

Unknown Speaker  28:19
Nice.

Speaker 1  28:23
So again, that's not for public consumption. It's just like to summarize after some cons it's pretty fun toy

Unknown Speaker  28:29
it is almost a recap video. Yeah, but

Speaker 1  28:31
if I send it to you as a referral partner, like it kind of makes you want to go I think we're like 10

Speaker 2  28:38
for sure that I think that's content you can use to make like a super cut.

Speaker 1  28:43
Yeah I'm famous anything that no. Oh, why don't you show me what you created that I don't know that exists. Okay, so this

Speaker 3  28:56
What's messed up using some info from the website just like bullet point

Speaker 1  29:09
control conference management

Unknown Speaker  29:17
this is simple to

Speaker 1  29:20
organizations. This happened between last night and this morning these two documents I didn't know you're doing I said we're gonna need their great stimulants, culture promoters. Employee centric companies. Yeah, that these are great Oh, nice okay. Yeah, that's scrape. I'll take all three of these, and I'll edit them slightly. But those are that's exactly what I need. Thank you.
