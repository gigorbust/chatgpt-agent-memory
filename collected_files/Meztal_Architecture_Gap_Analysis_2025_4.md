## 10. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP CONSIDERATIONS

### 10.1 Phased Build Recommendations

Given the 467-page gap, a phased approach is essential:

**PHASE 1: Foundation (Pillar Pages)**
- Build all 27 Pillar pages
- Establish primary navigation
- Create core URL directory structure
- Estimated: 27 pages

**PHASE 2: High-Priority Clusters (Spoke Pages)**
- Complete 4-6 highest-priority topic clusters with Pillar → Spoke → Leaf structure
- Suggested clusters: Nearshore IT Staffing, Solutions for Private Equity, Solutions for Startups, Comparison, Resources
- Estimated: 100-150 pages

**PHASE 3: Audience Expansion (Spoke + Leaf)**
- Complete remaining Solutions-for-X clusters
- Add remaining industry verticals
- Expand Resources hub
- Estimated: 150-200 pages

**PHASE 4: Long-Tail Completion (Leaf Pages)**
- Fill in remaining Leaf pages across all clusters
- Complete all comparison pages
- Finalize specialized content
- Estimated: 100-150 pages

- Option 4: Hybrid (Solutions + Industries + Audiences in mega-menu)

#### **C. CONTENT CREATION APPROACH**
**Question:** How should the 467 missing pages be created?
- Option 1: Manual creation with full customization
- Option 2: Template-based with content variables (Pillar/Spoke/Leaf templates)

- Option 4: AI-assisted content generation with human review

#### **D. URL STRUCTURE CONFIRMATION**
**Question:** Should we follow the exact URL patterns from the Architecture Map?
- Option 1: Yes, use exact URLs from Architecture Map (468 specific URLs)

- Option 3: Simplify URL structure (fewer directories)

#### **E. SANDBOX BUILD SCOPE**
**Question:** What is the immediate goal for the Wix Studio sandbox?
- Option 1: Proof of concept (1-2 complete clusters, ~15-30 pages)
- Option 2: MVP launch (All Pillars + 3-5 key clusters, ~100-150 pages)
- Option 3: Comprehensive build (All 468 pages)
- Option 4: Phased with clear milestones (define phase 1 scope)

- Option 5: All of the above
- Option 6: None initially (focus on content, add features later)

#### **I. EXISTING SANDBOX USAGE**
**Question:** What should happen to the existing 1-page sandbox?
- Option 1: Keep as homepage, build architecture around it
- Option 2: Replace entirely with Architecture-aligned homepage
- Option 3: Repurpose as a different page type

#### **J. TIMELINE & RESOURCES**
**Question:** What timeline and resources are available for this build?
