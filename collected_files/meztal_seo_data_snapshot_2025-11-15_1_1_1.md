**Leaf Pages** - Specific long-tail queries (40-50% of architecture)  
- Examples: hire-java-developer-nearshoring, offshore-web-development
- High conversion intent

---

2. **Comparison Page** - Significant (25%)
3. **Guide** - Educational (10%)
4. **Comparison** - Alternative format (8%)

- **Specialized:** VP of Engineering, Talent Lead, Operations Manager, Project Manager
- **End Users:** Job Seeker (for careers cluster)

---

## CRITICAL INSIGHTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Multi-Format Strategy
Many high-value keywords are intentionally mapped to 3 variants:
1. `/comparison/{keyword}` - Comparison Page
2. `/resources/{keyword}` - Guide format
3. `/services/{keyword}` - Landing Page

This allows:
- Multiple SERP entry points
- Intent-based routing  
- Authority building across content types

### Nearshore Specialization
Dedicated nearshore URL paths for:
- IT staffing: 10+ URLs
- Software development: 8+ URLs  
- Accounting/finance: 5+ URLs
- Customer support: 4+ URLs
- General staffing: 3+ URLs

This creates nearshore authority clusters separate from general outsourcing.

### Offshore Comparison Opportunity
Multiple offshore-* URLs position MezTal as alternative:
- Educate on offshore limitations
- Position nearshore advantages
- Capture offshore search traffic

---

## NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Validate URL structure in Wix CMS** - Ensure dynamic page routing supports architecture
2. **Map collections to URL patterns** - Services, Solutions, Resources collections must align
3. **Prioritize pillar page builds** - 15-20 highest-authority pages first
4. **Create content templates** - Per content type (Landing Page, Comparison, Guide, etc.)
5. **Build internal linking matrix** - Pillar → Spoke → Leaf hierarchy
6. **Set up tracking** - URL-level analytics for architecture validation

---

## ARCHITECTURE DEPENDENCIES

**Wix CMS Collections Required:**
- Services (with nested categories)
- Solutions (with industry/function tags)
- Resources (with content type taxonomy)  
- Locations (for location-based content)
- Case Studies (future integration)

**Dynamic Page Setup:**
- `/services/[service-slug]` - Item page from Services collection
- `/resources/[resource-slug]` - Item page from Resources collection
- `/comparison/[comparison-slug]` - Item page from custom Comparison collection
- `/nearshore-{vertical}/[service-slug]` - Vertical-specific routing

**URL Rewrite Rules Needed:**
- Handle multi-segment paths (/nearshore-it-staffing/*, /nearshore-software-development/*)
- Preserve SEO-friendly slugs
- Support future expansion

**Date Added:** November 15, 2025, 3:00 AM EST  
**Source:** Fellou AI MezTal Markdown Strategy Document

## PRIORITY BUILD ORDER (from Fellou AI)

The Fellou AI document specifies a **pillar-first strategy** that directly aligns with our architecture analysis. This provides the tactical execution sequence:

### PRIORITY 1: CORE PILLAR PAGES

**Build Sequence:**
1. **Homepage** (`/`) - Foundation & brand positioning
2. **Main Services Hub** (`/services`) - Central navigation pillar (Priority 9.4)
3. **Top 4 Service Pillars** (core revenue drivers):
   - IT Staffing Pillar (`/services/it-staffing`) - Largest cluster (145 pages)
   - Accounting Solutions Pillar (`/services/accounting-solutions`) - 2nd largest (94 pages) 
   - Call Center Outsourcing (`/services/call-center-outsourcing`) - Priority 9.7
   - Finance & Accounting Outsourcing (`/services/finance-and-accounting-outsourcing`) - Priority 9.8

### RATIONALE FOR PILLAR-FIRST

Fellou AI's strategy emphasizes:
- **Foundation First**: Pillar pages are the structural anchors for the entire site

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

**Combining architecture analysis + Fellou AI execution:**

   - Collections mapped to content types

✅ **Build pillar-first always**
   - Never build leaf pages without pillar foundation
   - Spoke pages inherit authority from pillars
   - Internal links flow downward (pillar → spoke → leaf)

✅ **Maintain data integrity**
   - Every page references source data
   - No fabricated statistics or claims
   - Transparent sourcing for credibility

✅ **Track progress systematically**
   - Master index updated per page completion
   - Gap analysis shows remaining work
   - Priority scores guide build sequence
