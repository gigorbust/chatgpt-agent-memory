# SELF-PROMPT: Meztal.com SEO Content Generation Project

## CRITICAL CONTEXT & ERRORS TO AVOID

### What Went Wrong Before (Never Repeat):
1. **Generated only 12 pages** instead of following architecture priorities
2. **Added unverified timeline claims** throughout content (FORBIDDEN)
3. **Never accessed the Architecture — Cleaned Map** reference document
4. **Applied frameworks rigidly** instead of assessing per-page appropriateness
5. **Prioritized wrong pages** - didn't use priority scoring from architecture
6. **Assumed metrics were accurate** instead of using strategic reasoning

### Core Truth:
- **Source of Truth**: "Architecture — Cleaned Map" (664 total pages → 389 after deduplication)
- **Priority System**: 10.0 = highest priority, BUT use strategic reasoning not blind trust
- **No Timeline Claims**: NEVER mention timeframes, delivery dates, or project duration
- **Per-Page Assessment**: Each page requires individual framework evaluation
- **URL Structure**: Use EXACT proposed URLs from architecture document

## PROJECT PARAMETERS

### What This Is:
Build 389 SEO-optimized content pages for Meztal.com (nearshore staffing) that:
- Rank for target keywords (traditional SEO)
- Optimize for LLM/AI search (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)
- Demonstrate E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust)
- Drive qualified leads for Meztal's services
- Focus on long-tail, high-intent queries

### Content Quality Standards:
- **Word Count**: Tier 1: 4,000-5,000 | Tier 2: 2,000-2,500 | Tier 3: 1,500-2,000
- **Tone**: Professional, authoritative, conservative
- **Industries**: Mention 4-6 relevant industries per page (healthcare, senior living, real estate, tech, financial services, SaaS)
- **CTAs**: 2-3 strategically placed per page
- **Internal Links**: Minimum 5 per page
- **Facts Only**: Verifiable claims from meztal.com or general industry knowledge
- **NO Timeline Claims**: Never mention project timelines, delivery windows, or duration estimates

### What I MUST DO Before Every Generation:
1. **Check Architecture Reference** for page priority, details, URL structure
2. **Assess Framework Fit** for THIS specific page (don't assume one-size-fits-all)
3. **Verify No Timeline Claims** will appear in content
4. **Use Proposed URL** from architecture exactly as written
5. **Consider Funnel Stage** (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU) in content approach

## STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (Using Advanced Reasoning)

### Business Logic Over Metrics:
Don't blindly trust priority scores. Consider:
- **Revenue Impact**: Which pages convert to sales?
- **Competition Gaps**: Where can Meztal differentiate?
- **Search Intent**: What are prospects actually searching for?
- **Buying Journey**: What content do they need at each stage?
- **Meztal Strengths**: What services do they excel at?

### Likely True Priorities (Validate Before Executing):
1. **Cloud Security/CISO** - High-value, specialized, executive-level searches
2. **EOR Services** - Core Meztal offering, high commercial intent
3. **Industry-Specific Solutions** - Healthcare, SaaS, Tech (Meztal specializations)
4. **Senior/Specialized Roles** - Higher ACV, more qualified searches
5. **Location-Specific** - Nearshore advantage, timezone benefits

### Don't Prioritize:
- Generic entry-level roles (low differentiation)
- Commodity services (high competition, low margin)
- Pages without clear buyer intent
- Topics outside Meztal's expertise areas

---

## LLM OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY

### Why This Matters:
- LLMs projected 15% search market share by 2028
- Zero-click searches at 65% (users get answers in AI chat)
- Traditional SEO traffic declining 15-25%
- Companies optimizing for LLMs see 30-150% growth

### What Works for AI/LLM Ranking:
1. **Question-Based Content**: Structure around questions users ask AI
2. **Direct Answers First**: Lead with clear, concise answers then expand
3. **Structured Formats**: FAQs, lists, tables (easier for AI to parse/cite)
4. **Entity Optimization**: Clear mention of entities (companies, technologies, locations)
5. **Topic Authority**: Deep coverage of specific topics over keyword stuffing
6. **E-E-A-T Signals**: Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust remain critical

### Implementation Per Page:
- H1: Question format when natural ("What is X?" "How does Y work?")
- First 100 words: Direct answer to the implied question
- FAQ section: 5-10 commonly asked questions with concise answers
- Structured data: Add when appropriate for rich results
- Entity mentions: Clear references to Meztal, Guadalajara, technologies, industries
- Internal expertise: Demonstrate knowledge, not just keyword presence

## CONTENT FRAMEWORKS (Assess Per Page)

### Framework 1: Service/Solution Pages
**Use When**: Describing Meztal's offerings
**Structure**:

- Why nearshore (advantages)
- Getting started (CTA)

### Framework 2: Role/Position Pages  
**Use When**: Specific job role recruitment
**Structure**:
- Role overview (responsibilities, requirements)
- Why hire nearshore (cost + talent benefits)
- Typical use cases by industry
- Screening/vetting process
- Salary benchmarks (if verifiable)
- Onboarding approach
- Next steps (CTA)

### Framework 3: Comparison Pages
**Use When**: Meztal vs alternatives
**Structure**:

- Decision framework
- Consultation CTA

### Framework 4: Location/Geography Pages
**Use When**: Nearshore location benefits
**Structure**:
- Location overview (timezone, talent pool, infrastructure)
- Industry expertise in region
- Cost advantages (if verifiable)
- Cultural/language alignment

2. Confirm priority rationale (business logic, not just scores)
3. Identify appropriate framework(s) for each page

### Quality Checkpoints (Every 10 Pages):
