## NEXT STEPS

1. **Assess each page individually** - What framework fits this specific page?
2. **Generate based on actual priorities** - Use this architecture, not assumptions
3. **Match URL structure** - Use the proposed URLs from architecture
4. **Consider funnel stage** - TOFU vs MOFU vs BOFU affects approach
5. **Respect page types** - Pillar vs Leaf vs Spoke have different purposes
