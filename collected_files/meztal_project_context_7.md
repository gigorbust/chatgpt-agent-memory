# MezTal Project Context & Data Index (as of 2025‑11‑11)

This document consolidates all available information from our MezTal/Wix Studio project.  It serves as a comprehensive reference and index for future sessions, helping prevent memory drift, repeated mistakes and overlooked tasks.

## 1. Project Overview

MezTal.com is being redesigned and rebuilt using Wix Studio.  The goal is to create a modern, SEO‑friendly site architecture that clearly communicates MezTal’s value proposition, drives lead generation, and scales easily as new services or industries are added.  The site is organised around key collections in Wix Studio (Services, Industries/Solutions, Case Studies, Resources, Locations and People) and uses dynamic pages to present content.

## 2. Completed Work

### 2.1 Collection Creation

All necessary CMS collections have been created in Wix Studio:

| Collection | Purpose | Key Fields |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Services** | Stores information about each service or offering (e.g., IT Staffing, Application Development) | `Title`, `short_description`, `long_description`, `thumbnail_image`, `hero_image`, `related_services`, `related_solutions`, `meta_description` |
| **Industries** | Holds industry/solution clusters (e.g., AgeTech, Healthcare, SaaS) | `Title`, `short_description`, `long_description`, `thumbnail_image`, `hero_image`, `related_services`, `related_case_studies`, `meta_title`, `meta_description` |
| **Case Studies** | Summarises client success stories | `client_name`, `project_name`, `challenge`, `solution`, `results`, `cover_image`, `related_services`, `related_solutions`, `meta_title`, `meta_description` |
| **Resources** | Houses blog posts, guides and other educational content | `Title`, `slug`, `type`, `excerpt`, `bodyRichText`, `author`, `publishedDate`, `cover_image`, `relatedServices`, `relatedSolutions`, `meta_description` |
| **Locations** | Describes nearshore hub locations | `cityName`, `short_description`, `long_description`, `mapEmbedUrl`, `meta_title`, `meta_description` |
| **People** | Profiles leadership or team members | `Title` (name), `roleTitle`, `bio`, `Image` (headshot), `socialLinks` |

Each collection has a corresponding set of dynamic list and item pages automatically generated by Wix Studio.  SEO fields (`meta_title`, `meta_description`) are used where necessary; slugs are handled automatically by Wix.

### 2.2 Data Entry & Field Configuration

For each collection, the following actions were completed:

- Added text, rich‑content and image fields to capture key information (e.g., descriptions, images).
- Added multi‑reference fields to link collections (e.g., `related_services`, `related_case_studies`).
- Added SEO metadata fields (`meta_description`, `meta_title` where needed) to support search engine optimisation.
- Completed the `resources` and `people` collections with extra fields like `author`, `publishedDate`, `socialLinks`.
- Verified that dynamic list and item pages were automatically generated for each collection.

### 2.3 Initial Customisation Attempts

- Opened the **Solutions List** dynamic page (services list) and inserted a repeater via a grid layout.
- Tried to connect the repeater to the services dataset but encountered difficulty selecting the correct element and binding the dataset; the repeater remained unconfigured.  This is a key unresolved task (see Section 3.2).

### 2.4 Logging & Documentation

- Developed a high‑level logging system based on JSONL and CSV files.  Logs are stored in `logs/YYYY‑MM` directories and summarised in narrative documents (`analysis_YYYY‑MM‑DD.md`, `logging_improvements.md`).
- Identified that the GitHub connector in our environment is read‑only; logs must be stored locally and uploaded manually.
- Created recommendations for enhancing logs with fields such as `status`, `duration`, `tool_used`, and categories (CMS Setup, Design Work, API Operations, Errors, Learnings).
- Generated this context document and an **open tasks** list for quick reference.

## 3. Outstanding Tasks & Gaps

### 3.1 Dynamic Page Design

The site currently uses Wix’s default dynamic list and item pages.  Customising these pages remains incomplete.  Outstanding work includes:

- **Bind repeaters to datasets:** Develop a reliable procedure for connecting repeaters to the `services` dataset (and other collections) on list pages.  Use the dataset anchor inside the repeater and the “Connect Repeater” panel.
- **Design item page layouts:** For each collection, design appealing item pages (e.g., show service descriptions, images, case study details and related items, plus a clear CTA button).
- **Home and navigation:** Build the Home page and global navigation menu so that visitors can easily access Services, Industries, Case Studies, Resources, Locations, About and Contact pages.  Use the improved site architecture developed earlier (Home → Services → Solutions → etc.).
- **Import content:** Once the site structure is ready, import actual service/industry data from the CSV files provided (`meztal_wix_import.csv`, cleaned architecture file) after user confirmation.

### 3.2 Logging & Memory Management

To prevent memory drift and ensure quick context retrieval:

- **Implement structured summaries:** After each session, create a `session_summary.md` outlining key tasks completed, unresolved issues, and recommended next steps.
- **Maintain an `open_tasks.md` file** that acts as a master checklist.  Update it at the end of each session.
- **Update logs with metadata:** Incorporate recommended fields (`status`, `duration`, `tool_used`, `category`) into the log formats.  This will aid future analysis.
- **Automate context loading:** At the start of each session, parse the most recent `session_summary.md` and `open_tasks.md` to reconstruct context.  When the user mentions “MezTal” or “Wix Studio,” automatically trigger this context retrieval.

## 4. Data Index

Below is a list of the key documents and where they reside in the repository (or local workspace).  Use this index to find information quickly.

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `analysis_2025-11-11.md` | `logs/2025-11/analysis_2025-11-11.md` (GitHub) | High‑level summary of the session on 2025‑11‑11: actions taken, issues, recommendations【965934797860842†L17-L21】. |
| `logging_improvements.md` | `logs/2025-11/logging_improvements.md` (GitHub) | Detailed guide on improving log structure (categories, metadata) and generating session summaries【489679944093096†L4-L16】. |
| `2025-11-11_*` logs | `logs/2025-11/2025-11-11_logs/` (GitHub) | Raw logs for actions, errors, learnings and actions CSV【794044713054317†L16-L24】. |
| `meztal_session_log.md` | Local workspace | Continuous session log capturing actions taken across multiple chats.  Updated after each session. |
| `meztal_project_context.md` (this file) | Local workspace | Comprehensive context and index; summarises all sessions and tasks. |
| `open_tasks.md` | Local workspace (to be created) | Master checklist of outstanding tasks.  Updated each session. |
| `analysis_and_improvements_2025-11-11.zip` | Local workspace | Zip archive containing analysis and logging improvements files for 2025‑11‑11. |
| `meztal_wix_import.csv` | Local workspace | Data for populating collections once structure is ready. |
| `Architecture — Cleaned Map` CSV | Local workspace | Cleaned architecture roadmap for site hierarchy. |

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Prepare Open Tasks Checklist:** Create `open_tasks.md` listing unresolved items (repeater binding, page design, navigation, content import).  Use this as a master to-do list.
2. **Finish Dynamic Pages:** Develop a step-by-step procedure for connecting repeaters to datasets; customise list and item pages; add CTAs; design home and navigation.
3. **Implement Logging Enhancements:** Update log formats to include metadata and categories.  Begin creating session summary and open tasks files at the end of each session.
4. **Manual GitHub Upload:** Once documents (`meztal_project_context.md`, `open_tasks.md`) are finalised, compress and share them with the user for manual upload to the repository.

## 6. Conclusion

This document compiles all current knowledge about the MezTal project.  By keeping it updated and following the recommendations in Sections 3 and 5, we can maintain continuity across sessions, minimise memory drift, and accelerate progress on the Wix Studio site.
