# MezTal Session Log

## Session: 2025‑11‑13

| Timestamp (approx.) | Tool Used | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 00:00 | GitHub connector | Re‑read existing project context documents (`meztal_project_context.md`, `open_tasks.md`, `session_summary_2025-11-11.md`, etc.) to ensure continuity. | Confirmed `meztal_session_log.md` did not exist in the repository. |
| 00:05 | Wix Studio editor (computer) | Loaded **Solutions (List)** page via the Pages dropdown. | Verified correct page selection through the highlighted entry and breadcrumb. |
| 00:10 | Layers panel | Opened the Layers panel using the left toolbar; navigated through `Header`, `Section`, `Section Grid`, and multiple `Repeater` entries. | Selected the correct repeater for the solutions list. |
| 00:12 | Dataset binding | Connected the selected repeater to the **Services dataset** via the **Connect Repeater** panel. | Panel showed `collection: services`, `100 items per load`, no filters. |
| 00:15 | Repeater item editing | Accidentally double‑clicked inside a repeater item, which detached the dataset and switched focus to an `Item`. | Used the undo arrow to revert and re‑selected the repeater via Layers panel. |
| 00:20 | Explore editing options | Opened the floating toolbar (Manage Content, Cards, chain icon).  Examined the **Repeater Content** panel. | Determined that the card design lacked image, heading, description and button elements. |
| 00:25 | Attempted to open Add panel | Tried multiple icons on the left toolbar (Site Pages, Global Sections, Site Styles) but could not locate the correct Add panel. | Need to identify the correct plus‑icon for adding elements. |
| 00:30 | Research external resources | Issued web searches for advanced Wix Studio workflows and account setup tips. | Many results pointed to Wix’s dynamic sites or forums, which could not be parsed via the browser tool. |
| 00:40 | Research summary | Noted general themes from accessible titles (workflow planning, advanced layout techniques, performance optimisation). | Marked external research as an open task due to limited accessible sources. |
| 00:45 | Documentation updates | Drafted session summary, updated open tasks with new instructions, prepared communication guidelines update, and created session log. | Stored files locally for user to upload to GitHub. |

## Notes

* The editor’s undo button is critical for recovering from mis‑steps.  Double‑clicking on repeater items resets the dataset connection.
* The Layers panel and breadcrumb navigation provide reliable ways to select repeaters and switch between items without detaching the dataset.
* The Add panel (plus‑icon) was difficult to locate; identification of its exact icon remains an open task.
* External research on Wix Studio workflows was largely unsuccessful due to dynamic web pages; alternative approaches are needed.
