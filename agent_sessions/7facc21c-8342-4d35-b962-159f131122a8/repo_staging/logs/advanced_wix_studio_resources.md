# Advanced Wix Studio Resources Summary

This document synthesises insights from external blogs and articles about advanced design techniques and best practices for setting up and customising sites in **Wix Studio**.  It captures concepts that are not currently documented in the MezTal project’s context files so that future sessions can reference them without re‑reading multiple external sources.

## 1 — High‑level design principles

* **Leverage custom animations and transitions** – Use Wix Studio’s built‑in animation tools to add depth and interactivity.  Dynamic effects help draw attention to key elements and make the site feel more polished【844077278591991†screenshot】.
* **Explore advanced layout options** – Go beyond the default drag‑and‑drop by experimenting with overlapping elements, parallax scrolling, asymmetrical layouts, and grid/flexbox combinations【844077278591991†screenshot】【895063832535926†screenshot】.  These techniques create unique, visually engaging pages that stand out from cookie‑cutter templates.
* **Customise typography and colour schemes** – Define your brand’s visual identity, then select or upload custom fonts and colour palettes.  Use no more than two fonts to maintain consistency, and stick to 2–3 main colours (primary, secondary, neutral) for a clean, professional look【379548262070052†screenshot】.  Apply these styles across the entire site using Wix’s Global Design settings【859282861127064†screenshot】.
* **Implement custom CSS and JavaScript** – For advanced users, Wix Studio (via **Velo by Wix**) allows insertion of custom code.  This enables custom animations, interactive behaviours and API integrations beyond the standard toolbox【616279413674865†screenshot】.

## 2 — Customising templates and components

* **Start with the right template and customise extensively** – Choose a template aligned with your industry and vision, but don’t hesitate to rearrange sections, adjust layouts and resize elements to create a unique flow【764965721316636†screenshot】.
* **Use unique media elements** – Replace default images and videos with high‑quality, branded visuals, and add transparent videos or GIFs for dynamic backgrounds【616279413674865†screenshot】.  Custom illustrations or icons add a distinctive touch【859282861127064†screenshot】.
* **Employ advanced design tools** – Take advantage of hover effects, transparent overlays and animation features built into Wix Studio【764965721316636†screenshot】.
* **Customise repeaters and dynamic pages** – Dynamic pages save time by allowing a single template to populate multiple items (e.g. blog posts, portfolios, products)【950856526817170†screenshot】.  Ensure your design works across all breakpoints using grid and flexbox layouts【743120558146491†screenshot】.
* **Enhance branding site‑wide** – Use consistent navigation, header/footer structures, brand‑coloured buttons and links, and apply uniform fonts and colours across pages.  Wix’s Global Design settings can apply changes site‑wide with a single click【859282861127064†screenshot】.

## 3 — Hidden features for a professional look

* **Grid‑based layouts** – Enable gridlines via `Tools` → `Gridlines` to ensure perfect alignment and spacing across screen sizes【616279413674865†screenshot】.  The grid system keeps elements symmetrical and responsive【743120558146491†screenshot】.
* **Velo by Wix (Dev Mode)** – Activating Dev Mode unlocks custom code, dynamic pages and API integrations.  This is essential for advanced functionality like dynamic filtering, interactive forms, or external data connections【616279413674865†screenshot】.
* **Transparent videos and hover effects** – Use WebM format as a background to create sleek visual interest.  Hover effects can animate buttons or text on interaction【616279413674865†screenshot】.
* **Parallax scrolling, fade‑in effects and sticky elements** – Subtle scroll‑based animations and sticky headers/footers add polish without overwhelming visitors【616279413674865†screenshot】.
* **Custom anchors and breadcrumbs** – Add anchor links for smooth scrolling on long pages and breadcrumbs to improve navigation.  These elements help users jump to sections and understand their location within the site【37744840520901†screenshot】.
* **Lightbox pop‑ups** – Use Wix Lightbox to present sign‑up forms, announcements or promotions in an eye‑catching yet unobtrusive manner【616279413674865†screenshot】.
* **Mobile editor** – Customise the mobile version separately to ensure a flawless user experience across devices【950856526817170†screenshot】.  Hide unnecessary elements and adjust spacing to declutter mobile views【895063832535926†screenshot】.
* **Advanced animations** – Wix provides scroll‑based animations and entry effects that can be applied to text, images and sections for a high‑end feel without heavy performance cost【950856526817170†screenshot】.
* **SEO and accessibility tools** – Use structured data markup, ARIA labels and custom meta tags to improve search rankings and accommodate assistive technologies【950856526817170†screenshot】.

## 4 — Smart layouts and grids

* **Flexbox technology** – In Wix Studio, flexbox layouts allow elements to automatically adjust size and position based on screen width, improving mobile usability and reducing manual adjustments【743120558146491†screenshot】.
* **Logical content flow** – Use headings and subheadings to break up content, employ white space to avoid clutter, and maintain consistent fonts and colours to enhance readability.  Repeaters are useful for structured, uniform sections like team profiles or service lists【895063832535926†screenshot】.
* **Sticky elements and call‑to‑action buttons** – Fix important elements (like navigation bars and floating CTAs) so they remain visible as users scroll【895063832535926†screenshot】.
* **Section‑based design** – Break pages into clear sections, each with a distinct focus (e.g. about, services, testimonials), using colour contrasts or dividers to separate them【459384097900524†screenshot】.  `Strip` elements can create full‑width sections with background images, videos or solid colours【459384097900524†screenshot】.
* **Consistent layout across pages** – Apply the same grid structure, margins and spacing on all pages.  Wix Site Themes help keep colours, fonts and button styles consistent【459384097900524†screenshot】.

## 5 — Branding and colour management

* **Define your brand identity** – Clarify brand personality and target audience, and ensure your website complements existing logos and materials【812807558079546†screenshot】.
* **Create a custom colour palette** – In the editor, go to `Site Design` → `Colours` to choose or build a colour palette.  Assign primary colours for key elements (logo, CTA buttons), secondary colours for supportive accents and neutral colours for backgrounds and subtle details【379548262070052†screenshot】.
* **Upload custom fonts** – Go to `Site Design` → `Text`, then `Upload Fonts` to add your own typography.  Use bold fonts for headings, simple fonts for body text and accent fonts sparingly for call‑outs【379548262070052†screenshot】.
* **Apply branding site‑wide** – Use Global Design Settings to ensure colours, fonts and button styles are applied consistently to all pages【859282861127064†screenshot】.
* **Custom graphics and icons** – Choose branded icons and buttons, use patterned or branded background images and incorporate custom illustrations or animations for a unique, recognisable look【859282861127064†screenshot】.

## 6 — Navigation best practices

* **Menus** – Keep navigation simple, clear and logical.  Arrange menu items in an intuitive order, use dropdowns for subcategories and keep the menu visible (sticky) on long pages【309405583319602†screenshot】.
* **Breadcrumbs** – Add breadcrumb trails on blog pages, e‑commerce stores and service sites to help users backtrack and to improve SEO【309405583319602†screenshot】.
* **Anchor links** – Use anchor links for smooth scrolling on long pages; they can link menu items or buttons to sections further down【37744840520901†screenshot】.
* **Secondary navigation** – Consider sidebars (for blogs or knowledge bases), footer menus (for policy/FAQ links) and search bars to help users find content quickly【37744840520901†screenshot】.

## 7 — AI‑powered design tools

* **AI‑driven layout suggestions and content recommendations** – Wix’s AI tools provide layout suggestions, recommend content and adjust designs automatically to enhance user experience【191523377031887†screenshot】.
* **Colour palette and image optimisation** – AI can suggest colour palettes and automatically enhance images to match your branding【191523377031887†screenshot】.
* **Automated SEO, chatbots and analytics** – AI features include automated SEO optimisation, AI‑generated chatbots and predictive analytics to understand user behaviour and improve conversion【191523377031887†screenshot】.
* **Wix ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence)** – Wix ADI can generate an entire website tailored to your needs, streamlining the initial design process.  It is particularly useful when time or design resources are limited【191523377031887†screenshot】.
