# GitHub Sync Plan

## Goal Description
Upload all files in `chatgpt-agent-memory-main` to a GitHub repository to ensure they are accessible in other sessions.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Authentication Required**: You are not currently logged in to GitHub CLI (`gh`), and this folder is not linked to a remote repository.
>
> I need you to either:
> 1.  **Provide a Repository URL**: Create a repo on GitHub.com and paste the URL here (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo.git`).
> 2.  **Login to CLI**: Open a terminal and run `gh auth login`, then let me know so I can create the repo for you.

## Proposed Changes
### Local
- [x] Initialize git repository.
- [x] Commit all current files.

### Remote
- [ ] Add remote origin (once URL is provided or created).
- [ ] Push code to main branch.

## Verification Plan
- Run `git remote -v` to verify linkage.
- Run `git push` and confirm success.
