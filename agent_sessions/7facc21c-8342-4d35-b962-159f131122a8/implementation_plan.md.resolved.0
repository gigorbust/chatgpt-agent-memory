# Cleanup Plan: Uninstall Atlassian Software

## Goal Description
The user wants to uninstall Atlassian software. I have identified that the only active components are `mcp-remote` processes running via `npx`. There are no native applications installed in standard locations.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> I will kill the running `mcp-remote` processes and clear the `npx` cache.
> I also found browser extension files for Jira/Confluence/Bitbucket. I recommend uninstalling these directly from your browser (Chrome/Edge/Comet) extensions page. I will not force delete these files to avoid corrupting browser profiles, unless explicitly requested.

## Proposed Changes

### System
- Kill processes matching `mcp-remote` and `atlassian`.
- Clear `~/.npm/_npx` cache to remove the cached Atlassian MCP server.

### Files
- None to delete in [/Applications](file:///Applications).
- Browser extension files will be left for manual removal via browser UI.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Verification
- Run `ps aux | grep -i atlassian` to ensure no processes are running.
- Run `ps aux | grep -i mcp-remote` to ensure no MCP processes are running.
