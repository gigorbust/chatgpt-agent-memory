# User Communication Guidelines Update – 13 Nov 2025 Addendum

## New guideline: Handling system/network restrictions

- **Report environment issues immediately** – If you encounter a system-level error or network problem (e.g. `ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED`), stop attempting further actions that rely on the affected tool.  Document the issue and inform the user as soon as possible.
- **Do not repeatedly attempt blocked actions** – Once a connection failure occurs across multiple domains, recognise that it is a systemic issue.  Avoid wasting time on repeated page reloads or navigation attempts.
- **Shift focus to offline tasks** – When network access is blocked, prioritise tasks that do not require the `computer` tool, such as reading/writing documentation via the API, updating logs, refining processes, or researching accessible resources via the `browser` tool.
- **Recommend session reset** – Suggest starting a new session once the network restriction is resolved.  Provide a detailed prompt for the new session so progress can resume smoothly.
