- **Result:** URL now /solutions/application-development-outsourcing ✅

### Key Hierarchy Principles:

   - /services = Standalone overview page
   - SEO: Use "Services" in titles (3x higher search volume)

2. Parent-Child Relationships:
   - Home → 7 direct children (solutions, services, industries, locations, resources, about, contact)
   - Main Services Hub → 5 service pages

3. Geographic Accuracy:
   - ❌ Houston = US-based (NOT nearshore)
   - ✅ Nearshore ONLY: Guadalajara (GDL) and Mexico City

4. Static SEO Pages (40+): Intentionally FLAT structure
5. CMS Collections (7): Already configured

### ⚠️ REDUNDANCY & DUPLICATE ANALYSIS

#### 🔁 Potential Redundancies Identified:

**1. Services/Solutions Overlap:**
- `/solutions` = Main Services Hub (parent page)
- `/services` = Services Overview (standalone page)
- **Status:** ✅ NOT redundant - Intentional strategy
- **Reason:** Different purposes per user instruction
  - `/solutions` houses nested service pages
  - `/services` provides overview using "Services & Solutions" branding

**2. IT Staffing Pages:**
- `/solutions/it-staffing-development` (Core optimized page) ✅
- "IT Staffing" (Static SEO landing page) 📋
- **Status:** 🔁 POTENTIAL DUPLICATE
- **Recommendation:** Review if both are needed; may consolidate or differentiate focus

**3. Accounting/Finance Pages:**
- `/solutions/accounting-finance` (Core optimized page) ✅
- "Finance & Accounting Outsourcing" (Static SEO landing page) 📋
- "Accounting Solutions" (Static SEO landing page) 📋
- "Accounting Outsourcing" (Static SEO landing page) 📋
- "Accounting Services" (Static SEO landing page) 📋
- "Best Accounting Firms" (Static SEO landing page) 📋
- **Status:** 🔁 HIGH REDUNDANCY
- **Recommendation:** Consolidate or create clear differentiation:
  - Main service page: `/solutions/accounting-finance`
  - SEO landing pages: Should target specific long-tail keywords
  - Consider: Different buyer intents, locations, or use cases

**4. Testimonials Page:**
- `/testimonials` (LIVE on website) ✅
- ⚠️ NOT listed in Wix Studio sandbox page list
- **Status:** ⚠️ MISSING FROM SANDBOX
- **Recommendation:** Investigate why this page exists on live site but not in sandbox editor
  - May be using CMS-generated content
  - May be legacy page that needs migration
  - May be embedded section, not standalone page

---

### 📋 GAP ANALYSIS SUMMARY

   - 11 core pages fully optimized ✅
   - 23+ SEO landing pages built (need optimization) 📋
   - 7 CMS collections configured 📦
   - 1 page needs content 🏗️

3. **Deployment Priority:**
   - 🔴 **URGENT:** Deploy 11 core optimized pages (Main services, solutions, industries, locations, resources, contact)
   - 🟡 **HIGH:** Review and optimize 23+ SEO landing pages
   - 🟡 **MEDIUM:** Populate CMS collections with content
   - 🔵 **LOW:** Build remaining "New Page"

4. **Redundancy Concerns:**
   - Multiple accounting/finance pages need differentiation strategy
