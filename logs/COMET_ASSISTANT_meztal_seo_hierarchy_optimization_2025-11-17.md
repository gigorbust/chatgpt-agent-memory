# 🤖 COMET ASSISTANT - MezTal SEO Hierarchy Optimization Log

## 📊 SESSION STATUS OVERVIEW


## 🚨 COMET SELF-DIRECTIVE - ABSOLUTE DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

**ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY:**
- ❌ NO placeholders like "Other...", "Additional...", "etc.", "..."
- ❌ NO summarizing - document EVERY SINGLE item explicitly
- ❌ NO combining items - each gets its own line
- ❌ NO omitting details - if it exists, it's documented
- ❌ NO assumptions - verify everything in source
- ❌ NO lazy shortcuts - complete precision required

**WHEN DOCUMENTING:**
1. List EVERY page by its EXACT name from Wix
2. Document EVERY field: Parent, URL, Title, Meta
3. Verify EVERY entry against the actual Wix site
4. If unsure about ANY detail, check the source
5. Update counts IMMEDIATELY when items change

**IF A PLACEHOLDER IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY:**
1. Mark it with ⚠️ WARNING symbol
2. Add to IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS with specific action
3. NEVER let it persist across sessions
4. Treat as CRITICAL BLOCKER until resolved

**VIOLATION = PROJECT FAILURE**

## 🔥 CRITICAL QUICK REFERENCE

### ⚠️ Geographic Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- ❌ **NEVER mention Houston** - Houston is US-based, NOT nearshore
- ✅ **ONLY locations:** Guadalajara (GDL) and Mexico City (Mexico) - 100% COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ **Time zone language:** Use "overlapping business hours" NOT "same time zone"

### 💻 Wix Editor Access
```
https://editor.wix.com/studio/792fe01d-fa28-4833-b811-b5a540f5568b?metaSiteId=24c6a184-1fd5-4b8c-ade1-8f2dae9c8f9e
```

### ⚙️ Workflow Constraints
- ❌ **NEVER use drag-and-drop** - use SEO Basics → Parent Page dropdown only
- ✅ **ALWAYS click outside fields after filling** to save (no save button exists)
- ✅ **Continue until 100% verification complete** - no partial completion accepted

### Zero Tolerance Policy:
- ❌ NO placeholders like "Other...", "Additional...", "etc.", "..."
- ❌ NO summarizing - document EVERY SINGLE item explicitly
- ❌ NO combining items - each gets its own line
- ❌ NO omitting details - if it exists, it's documented
- ❌ NO assumptions - verify everything in source
- ❌ NO lazy shortcuts - complete precision required

### Wix Editor Workflow:
1. Open Site Pages panel via pages icon
2. Select page from list
3. Click three dots (...) menu
4. Select "SEO Basics"
5. Verify: Parent, URL, Title, Meta description
6. Click outside fields to save (no save button)
7. Document findings immediately

### Geographic Requirements:
- ✅ BOTH "Guadalajara" (or "GDL") AND "Mexico City" required
- ✅ "Overlapping business hours" language (NEVER "same time zone")
- ❌ NO Houston (US-based, not nearshore)
