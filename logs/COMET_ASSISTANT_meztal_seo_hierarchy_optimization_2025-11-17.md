# 🤖 COMET ASSISTANT - MezTal SEO Hierarchy Optimization Log

## 📊 SESSION STATUS OVERVIEW


## 🚨 COMET SELF-DIRECTIVE - ABSOLUTE DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

**ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY:**
- ❌ NO placeholders like "Other...", "Additional...", "etc.", "..."
- ❌ NO summarizing - document EVERY SINGLE item explicitly
- ❌ NO combining items - each gets its own line
- ❌ NO omitting details - if it exists, it's documented
- ❌ NO assumptions - verify everything in source
- ❌ NO lazy shortcuts - complete precision required

**WHEN DOCUMENTING:**
1. List EVERY page by its EXACT name from Wix
2. Document EVERY field: Parent, URL, Title, Meta
3. Verify EVERY entry against the actual Wix site
4. If unsure about ANY detail, check the source
5. Update counts IMMEDIATELY when items change

**IF A PLACEHOLDER IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY:**
1. Mark it with ⚠️ WARNING symbol
2. Add to IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS with specific action
3. NEVER let it persist across sessions
4. Treat as CRITICAL BLOCKER until resolved

**VIOLATION = PROJECT FAILURE**
