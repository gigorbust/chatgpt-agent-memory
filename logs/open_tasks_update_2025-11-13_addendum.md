# Open Tasks Update – 13 Nov 2025 Addendum

This addendum should accompany the existing `open_tasks.md` file.  It **does not replace** the original file but adds context about a blocking issue encountered during the new session on 13 Nov 2025.

## New issue added

### Network connectivity problem

- During the 13 Nov 2025 session, the `computer` tool could not access any external web pages, resulting in an **ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED** error for every attempted URL (including `manage.wix.com` and simple sites like `example.com`).  This prevented further editing of the Wix site.
- **Impact:** All outstanding tasks that require interacting with the Wix Studio editor (binding repeaters, adjusting zoom, replicating patterns across list templates) remain **unfinished**.  Progress can only resume once the environment’s network access is restored.
- **Action:** Start a fresh session once the network issue is resolved, reload the project context, and continue with the dynamic page bindings.  Until then, focus on documentation tasks or offline research if necessary.

## Reminder of outstanding tasks

Refer to `open_tasks.md` for the full list of remaining tasks.  Key items include:

- **Complete dynamic page bindings** for Industries, Services, Case Studies, Resources, and Locations list templates.
- **Replicate the repeater binding pattern** across all list pages using each page’s dataset and analogous fields.
- **Verify SEO patterns and slugs**, adjust zoom for better visibility, and ensure no duplicate datasets are created.
- **Continue documentation and logging** improvements: refine logs, update communication guidelines, and develop process automation scripts.
