- 8 topics, 18 pages
- May be too broad for focused strategy

### KEY INSIGHTS

   - Must balance quick wins with long-term authority building
   - Early phases build foundation for later competitive plays

2. **Geographic Focus:**
   - Guadalajara appears in both lists with different angles
   - Opportunity for comprehensive Guadalajara content hub
   - Could create location-specific pillar page

3. **Service vs. Solution Split:**
   - Nearshore list: Service-provider focused (agencies, firms, services)
   - Outsourcing list: Solution-seeker focused (EOR, payroll, remote work)
   - MezTal can target both with different content approaches

4. **Difficulty Distribution:**
   - Low competition (0-20% KD): 8 pages, 2,650 volume
   - Medium competition (21-35% KD): 6 pages, 8,170 volume
   - High competition (56-67% KD): 4 pages, 35,890 volume

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **Export both keyword lists to CSV** for detailed analysis
2. **Map content calendar** using phased approach above
3. **Identify pillar page consolidation opportunities** (especially for "staffing agency mexico")
4. **Configure Position Tracking** for all 18 target pages
5. **Create content briefs** for Phase 1 pages (quick wins)
6. **Develop backlink strategy** for Phase 4 high-competition pages

### CONCLUSION

The "Nearshore Staffing Mexico" list complements the "Outsourcing Mexico" list by:
- Adding high-volume opportunities (especially the 31.9K "work from home" page)
- Focusing on service-provider angle vs solution-seeker angle
- Providing nearshore/remote development keywords
- Targeting international staffing firm searches

**Recommendation:** Keep lists separate but coordinate implementation using the 4-phase strategy above. Start with low-competition pages to build authority, then tackle the high-volume competitive keywords in Phase 4.

**Total Opportunity:** 42,930 monthly searches across 18 pages with balanced mix of quick wins and long-term authority targets.
