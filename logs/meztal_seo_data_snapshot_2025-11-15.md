## CRITICAL INSIGHTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Multi-Format Strategy
Many high-value keywords are intentionally mapped to 3 variants:
1. `/comparison/{keyword}` - Comparison Page
2. `/resources/{keyword}` - Guide format
3. `/services/{keyword}` - Landing Page

This allows:
- Multiple SERP entry points
- Intent-based routing  
- Authority building across content types

### Nearshore Specialization
Dedicated nearshore URL paths for:
- IT staffing: 10+ URLs
- Software development: 8+ URLs  
- Accounting/finance: 5+ URLs
- Customer support: 4+ URLs
- General staffing: 3+ URLs

This creates nearshore authority clusters separate from general outsourcing.

### Offshore Comparison Opportunity
Multiple offshore-* URLs position MezTal as alternative:
- Educate on offshore limitations
- Position nearshore advantages
- Capture offshore search traffic

## NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Validate URL structure in Wix CMS** - Ensure dynamic page routing supports architecture
2. **Map collections to URL patterns** - Services, Solutions, Resources collections must align
3. **Prioritize pillar page builds** - 15-20 highest-authority pages first
4. **Create content templates** - Per content type (Landing Page, Comparison, Guide, etc.)
5. **Build internal linking matrix** - Pillar → Spoke → Leaf hierarchy
6. **Set up tracking** - URL-level analytics for architecture validation

---

## ARCHITECTURE DEPENDENCIES

**Wix CMS Collections Required:**
- Services (with nested categories)
- Solutions (with industry/function tags)
- Resources (with content type taxonomy)  
- Locations (for location-based content)
- Case Studies (future integration)

**Dynamic Page Setup:**
- `/services/[service-slug]` - Item page from Services collection
- `/resources/[resource-slug]` - Item page from Resources collection
- `/comparison/[comparison-slug]` - Item page from custom Comparison collection
- `/nearshore-{vertical}/[service-slug]` - Vertical-specific routing

**URL Rewrite Rules Needed:**
- Handle multi-segment paths (/nearshore-it-staffing/*, /nearshore-software-development/*)
- Preserve SEO-friendly slugs
- Support future expansion
