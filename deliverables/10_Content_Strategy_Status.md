## Executive Summary

The content strategy has been defined and is currently in the **Creation Phase**. We have separated "Resources" (Evergreen/Sales support) from "Blog" (News/Culture) to better serve different user intents.

## Strategy Definition

### 1. The "Iceberg" Content Model
*   **Core Pages:** High-level brand messaging (Home, Why Mexico).
*   **Deep Content:** Hundreds of "Hidden" pages targeting specific roles (e.g., "Hire Data Engineer") and locations.
*   **Resources:** Buyer's guides, comparisons ("Nearshore vs Offshore"), and case studies.
*   **Blog:** Company news, culture updates, and industry commentary.

### 2. Blog Integration
*   **Platform:** Wix Blog.
*   **Categories:**
    *   Senior Living & Aging
    *   Events & Conferences
    *   MezTal Team & Culture
    *   Leadership & Insights

### 3. Content Production
*   **Relume Integration:** We are using Relume to generate structured wireframes and initial copy for all key pages.
*   **Differentiation:** Specific content is being created to distinguish "AgeTech" from "Elder Care" to target distinct buyer personas.

## Next Steps
*   **Execute Relume Prompt:** Generate the actual content wireframes.
*   **Write "Hidden" Page Copy:** Produce the unique content for the 150+ priority SEO pages.
