## Executive Summary

On-page optimization is the next immediate phase following content generation. The strategy is defined, but execution is pending the creation of the page content itself.

## Strategy Overview

### 1. "Iceberg" Optimization
*   **Target:** 400+ specific landing pages.
*   **Method:** Each page will be optimized for a specific long-tail keyword (e.g., "Hire Python Developer in Mexico") rather than generic terms.
*   **Elements:**
    *   **H1:** Exact match primary keyword.
    *   **Meta Title:** "[Keyword] | MezTal Nearshore Staffing".
    *   **URL Slug:** Clean, keyword-rich (e.g., `/nearshore-it-staffing/hire-python-developer`).
    *   **Content:** 800+ words of unique, helpful content per page to avoid "Thin Content" penalties.

### 2. Programmatic SEO Approach
*   We will use Wix Studio's dynamic pages to scale this optimization efficiently while maintaining unique content for key fields.

## Next Steps
1.  **Generate Content:** Create the copy for the first batch of 50 priority pages.
2.  **Implement:** Upload content to Wix CMS.
3.  **Optimize:** Apply on-page SEO rules (H1, Meta, Alt Text) during population.
