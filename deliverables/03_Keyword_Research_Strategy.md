## Executive Summary

The keyword research phase has produced a definitive "Source of Truth" for the website's information architecture (IA). We have moved away from a generic "47 roles" approach to a data-driven **Cluster Strategy** that aligns with actual business revenue (Closed-Won deals) and high-intent search volume.

## Core Keyword Clusters

Based on the `MEZTAL_SITE_RESEARCH_IA_MASTER_v3.md`, the site is organized around these primary clusters:

1.  **Accounting & Finance Staffing** (Top Revenue Driver)
    *   *Keywords:* Staff Accountant, Controller, AP Specialist, Nearshore Accounting.
2.  **IT & Data Staffing**
    *   *Keywords:* Full Stack Developer, Data Engineer, Python Developer, Nearshore IT.
3.  **Marketing & Creative Staffing**
    *   *Keywords:* Digital Marketing Specialist, UI/UX Designer, SEO Specialist.
4.  **HR & Talent Solutions**
    *   *Keywords:* Recruiter, HR Generalist, Employer of Record (EOR).
5.  **Industries (Verticals)**
    *   *Keywords:* Senior Living Staffing, AgeTech Recruitment, Healthcare BPO.

## The "Iceberg" Strategy

We have adopted an "Iceberg" architecture for content mapping:
*   **Visible:** A clean, simple menu for human users (Solutions, Industries, Why Mexico).
*   **Hidden (SEO):** Hundreds of specific landing pages mapped to long-tail keywords (e.g., "Hire React Developer in Mexico") that are linked via footer and content hubs but do not clutter the main navigation.

## Deliverables Produced

*   **Master Keyword Map:** `MEZTAL_SEO_MASTER_Minimal_2025-09-22_R3.xlsx` (Contains 1,400+ keywords).
*   **IA Strategy Log:** `MEZTAL_SITE_RESEARCH_IA_MASTER_v3.md` (The canonical logic document).
*   **Sitemap:** `meztal_sitemap_final.xml` (The technical implementation map).

## Next Steps
*   **Content Generation:** Execute the `MEZTAL_RELUME_PROMPT_FINAL.md` to generate wireframes and copy for these mapped pages.
