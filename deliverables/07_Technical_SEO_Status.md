**Date:** November 30, 2025
**Status:** 🏗️ In Progress
**SOW Item:** 7. Technical SEO Enhancements

---

## Executive Summary

Technical SEO implementation is underway. The foundation has been laid with proper URL structures and sitemap planning. Advanced technical configurations (Schema, Robots.txt) are scheduled for the implementation phase.

## Completed Actions

1.  **Sitemap Architecture:** A flat, clean URL structure has been defined to ensure all pages are within 3 clicks of the homepage.
2.  **HTTPS/SSL:** Enabled by default on Wix Studio.
3.  **Mobile Responsiveness:** Wix Studio foundation is built mobile-first.

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Schema Markup (Structured Data)
We will implement the following Schema types:
*   **Organization:** On the homepage (Logo, Social Profiles, Contact).
*   **Service:** On all Service pages (Name, Description, Area Served).
*   **JobPosting:** On Career pages (if applicable).
*   **FAQPage:** On all pages with FAQ sections.
*   **LocalBusiness:** For specific location pages (if physical offices exist).

### 2. Core Web Vitals
*   **Goal:** Achieve 90+ scores on Mobile.
*   **Action:** Optimize image sizes (WebP format), minimize JS execution, and use Wix's native performance tools.

### 3. Robots.txt & Indexing
*   **Configuration:** Ensure "Hidden" SEO pages are **Allowed** in robots.txt (even if hidden from menu) so Google can crawl them.
*   **Canonical Tags:** Self-referencing canonicals will be set for all pages to prevent duplicate content issues.

## Next Steps
*   Implement Schema markup during the "Wix Implementation" phase.
*   Run a technical audit (Semrush Site Audit) once the first 50 pages are live.
