## Executive Summary

LinkedIn is a key channel for MezTal's B2B marketing. Integration will focus on social proof and community building.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Social Proof
*   **Feed Embed:** Embed the active MezTal LinkedIn feed on the "Company" or "About" page to show recent activity and culture.
*   **Follow Buttons:** Prominent LinkedIn icons in the Header and Footer.

### 2. Content Sharing
*   **Share Buttons:** Enable "Share to LinkedIn" on all Blog posts and Resource pages.
*   **Open Graph Tags:** Optimize OG tags (Title, Image, Description) so links shared on LinkedIn look professional and clickable.

## Next Steps
*   Implement during the "Visual Design" and "Technical SEO" phases.
